### 11.0.2.15
* When enabled in settings, the Tom Tom waypoints support feature will now "add"
  waypoints rather than just maintaining adding/removing a single waypoint.
* TWW Epic Boss type world quests now have the appropriate icon at the front
  of the row, similar to pet battles, etc.
* Fixed a bug that was introduced in version 11.0.2.13.
* Now that Bloody Tokens are also part of the TWW expansion, the filter settings
  for that currency has been moved next to "Honor".

### 11.0.2.14
* The locked "Special Assignment" (Capstone) world quests are now included. While
  locked, what's provided by the addon is primarily informational. Once unlocked, then
  it becomes like any other world quest. 
* Dragon Rider Racing type world quests now have the appropriate icon at the front
  of the row, similar to pet battles, etc.
* Updated settings options:
  * Added new option to filter out Dragon Rider Racing type world quests.  It's 
    under "Filter by type".
  * Moved the filter setting for "Bloody Tokens" to within the Dragon Isles section.
  * Added new checkbox option (at the bottom of the list) to enable/disable
    "Spew Debug Information".  This is intended for use by those working on the 
    addon and should be unchecked for most users unless requested by a developer.

### 11.0.2.13
* Added support for world quests that only provide information regarding
  an XP reward to the addon API. In other words, there are world quests that
  have a line of blue text when you inspect it, "Awards a one-time Warband
  reputation bonus", but the addon API provides no other information about it.
  So, long story short, for these particular quests, the broker window will only
  show how much XP it provides.
* Began the process of cleaning up the source to be easier to read, consolidate 
  local variables together, avoid using local variables that aren't needed, etc.
  There will be a lot of line changes, but this (and future similar changes) will
  not affect functionality unless it's described in this file.
